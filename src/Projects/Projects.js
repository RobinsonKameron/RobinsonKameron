            TempÂ° is the intersection of music, tech, data, and motion: a perfect metaphor for the SXSW experience!
            This experience was designed and developed by an IBM Maelstrom team. Using inspiration from the core experiences of the Weather Underground app, our team of 11 interns conceptualized, designed and built the experience in only four and a half days.
          </p>
